- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan Evans
- ⚡  I learned how to code because I needed tools for my real estate business that didn't exist. When I saw the power of coding, I knew I had to go all in.
- 👀 I’m into travel, real estate investing, technology, remodeling houses, crypto, snowboarding and all things outdoors. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.JS, Node.JS, SASS, and TypeScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a job where I can build cool front-end projects with smart people.
- 📫 How to reach me - find me on linkedin at Ryan Evans Consulting, located in Seattle, WA.
