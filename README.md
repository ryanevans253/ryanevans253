- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Evans
- âš¡  I learned how to code because I needed tools for my real estate business, but those tools didn't exist anywhere, so I built them. Then I discovered the power of coding and went all in with it.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into travel, real estate investing, technology, remodeling houses, crypto, snowboarding, mountain biking, and all things outdoors. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working mostly with React, TypeScript, Next.JS, REST API's, SASS, and WordPress core.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - find me on linkedin at Ryan Evans Consulting, located in Seattle, WA.
